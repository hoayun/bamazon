# bamazon
#### Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. Customers will be unable to purchase if there is not enough stock available. After each buy from the customer the total purchase cost is displayed.

### In this example the user purchases exactly 1 hat for $10.

### Notice that the quantity of hats changed from 100 to 99.

### If there is not enough stock for the purchase the user will get a warning and not perform the transaction.
